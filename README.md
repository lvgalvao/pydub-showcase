# Just a Pydub showcase

Pydub is a simple and easy-to-use library for audio manipulation. It is written in pure Python and does not require any external libraries. It can read, filter, and modify audio files.

Imagine a project that requires a conversation with any LLM model. So, you need to read an audio file, fill the gaps, and silence it before sending it to the model. Pydub makes this process easy.

## Installation

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
